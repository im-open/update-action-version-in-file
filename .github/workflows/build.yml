name: Build and Check for Changes
on:
  # This workflow uses the pull_request trigger which prevents write permissions and secrets
  # access to the target repository from public forks.  This should remain as a pull_request
  # trigger because checkout, build, format and checking for changes do not need elevated
  # permissions to the repository.  The reduced permissions for public forks is adequate.
  # Since this will commit readme/recompile changes back to the branch, special attention 
  # should be paid to changes made to this workflow when reviewing the PR and granting 
  # permission to first time contributors to run the workflow.
  pull_request:
  # Don't include any specific paths here so we always get a build that produces a status
  # check that our Branch Protection Rules can use.  Having a status check also allows us
  # to require that branches be up to date before they are merged.
